# Travel Website

This is a responsive Travel Website created using only HTML and CSS.  
It showcases a simple and clean design for people who love to explore new places.

## Project Details

The website is designed to give users a basic idea of a travel agency or a personal travel blog.  
It includes the main sections you usually see in such websites, like:

- *Navbar*: For smooth navigation across the website.
- *Hero Section*: With a big travel message and a beautiful background image.
- *Footer*: Contains contact details and social media links.
- *Responsive Design*: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How I Built It

- I started with basic HTML to create the structure of the page.
- Used CSS for styling and making it look attractive.
- Focused on making the design mobile-friendly using media queries.
- Tested the website on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.

## Challenges Faced

- Making the hero section look good on both large and small screens.
- Aligning the navbar items properly for mobile view.
- Making sure the layout doesn't break when resized.

## How I Solved Them

- Used *flexbox* and *media queries* in CSS to control the layout.
- Adjusted font sizes, images, and paddings for different devices.
- Repeatedly tested the design and made improvements.
